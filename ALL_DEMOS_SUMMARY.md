**Do:**
- Click "Event Details" button
- Show retrieved documents
- Expand the comparison section

**Say:**
> "This is YOUR data, not made up. See the sources?"

### Demo 3: Multi-Agent 🤝
**Do:**
- Click "AI-Powered Dev Tool" button
- Narrate as each agent works
- Show how they build on each other

**Say:**
> "Each agent is an expert. Together, they solve what no single agent could."

### Demo 4: Planning 📋
**Do:**

## 🔑 Key Messages to Emphasize

### Throughout Presentation

1. **Rapid Prototyping**
   - "Built in hours with GitHub Copilot"
   - "Azure AI Foundry handles infrastructure"
   - "You can start today"

2. **Production Patterns**
   - "These aren't toys - they're production patterns"
   - "Companies use these for real workflows"
   - "Start simple, scale up"

3. **Composability**
   - "Combine these patterns in production"
   - "RAG + Tools, Multi-Agent + Planning"
   - "Mix and match for your needs"

### In Wrap-Up

**The Four Patterns:**
- **Tool Use** = Action
- **RAG** = Knowledge
- **Multi-Agent** = Collaboration
- **Planning** = Structure

**When to Use:**
- Tool Use: External actions needed
- RAG: Your data matters
- Multi-Agent: Multiple perspectives needed
- Planning: Complexity requires structure

**How to Start:**
- Pick one pattern
- Build a simple prototype
- Test and iterate
- Add complexity as needed
