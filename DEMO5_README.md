# Demo 5: Trend Research System 📊

## Overview

This demo showcases a **sophisticated multi-agent research system** designed for marketing agencies. It demonstrates the most complex agentic pattern yet: combining **parallel data collection**, **sequential analysis**, and **multi-source synthesis** to generate comprehensive market research reports.

## What It Demonstrates

### Key Concepts
- ✅ **Parallel Agent Execution** - Multiple agents working simultaneously
- ✅ **Sequential Processing** - Ordered analysis and synthesis phases
- ✅ **Multi-Source Data Aggregation** - Combining 5 different platforms
- ✅ **Complex Orchestration** - Coordinating 6 specialized agents
- ✅ **Real-World Application** - Production-ready pattern for marketing research

### Agentic Pattern: Hybrid Multi-Agent + Tool Use
The system uses a **two-phase architecture**:

**Phase 1 (Parallel):** Data Collection
- 3 agents collect data simultaneously from 5 platforms
- Faster execution through parallel processing
- Independent data sources

**Phase 2 (Sequential):** Analysis & Synthesis
- Insight Analyst processes all collected data
- Report Generator creates client-ready output
- Ordered workflow ensures quality

## Mock vs Real APIs

### Current Implementation (Mock)

The demo uses **`api_connectors_mock.py`** with realistic sample data:

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Works offline
- ✅ No API keys needed
- ✅ Instant responses (simulated delays)
- ✅ Consistent data for demos
- ✅ No rate limits or costs

**Mock Data Includes:**
- Realistic tweet/video/post content
- Accurate metrics and engagement numbers
- Proper sentiment distribution
- Geographic and demographic data
- Trending topics and hashtags

### Production Implementation (Real APIs)

For production use, create **`api_connectors_real.py`** with:

```python
# Twitter/X API
import tweepy

# TikTok API
from TikTokApi import TikTokApi

# Reddit API
import praw

# Google Trends
from pytrends.request import TrendReq

# Web Search (Bing/Google)
from azure.cognitiveservices.search.websearch import WebSearchClient
```

**See `DEMO5_REAL_APIS_GUIDE.md` for implementation details** (to be created).

## Customization Guide

### Adding New Research Questions

```python
RESEARCH_QUESTIONS["your_topic"] = {
    "title": "Your Topic Title",
    "question": "Your research question here?",
    "focus": "Key focus areas",
    "search_terms": ["term1", "term2", "term3"]
}
```

### Modifying Agent Prompts

Edit the `AGENTS` dictionary to customize agent behavior:

```python
AGENTS["insight_analyst"]["system_prompt"] = """
Your custom prompt here...
Focus on specific aspects...
"""
```

### Adding More Platforms

1. Add new API connector to `api_connectors_mock.py`
2. Create collection function in `demo5_trend_research.py`
3. Update data aggregation logic
4. Modify report generation to include new platform

### Adjusting Report Format

Modify the `report_prompt` in `generate_report()` function:

```python
report_prompt = f"""
Add your custom sections:
8. COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS
9. MARKET OPPORTUNITIES
10. RISK ASSESSMENT
"""
```

---

## Technical Implementation

### Parallel Execution

```python
# Phase 1: All agents run simultaneously
col1, col2, col3 = st.columns(3)

with col1:
    social_data = collect_social_media_data(...)
with col2:
    trends_data = collect_trends_data(...)
with col3:
    web_data = collect_web_intelligence(...)
```

**Benefits:**
- Faster execution
- Better resource utilization
- Independent failure handling

### Sequential Processing

```python
# Phase 2: Ordered execution
insights = analyze_insights(...)  # Must complete first
report = generate_report(insights, ...)  # Uses insights
```

**Benefits:**
- Quality control
- Logical flow
- Error propagation

### Data Aggregation

```python
all_data = {
    "social_media": {
        "twitter": twitter_data,
        "tiktok": tiktok_data,
        "reddit": reddit_data
    },
    "trends": trends_data,
    "web_intelligence": web_data
}
```

## Production Considerations

### 1. Real API Integration
- Implement `api_connectors_real.py`
- Add authentication
- Handle rate limits
- Implement retries

### 2. Caching
```python
@st.cache_data(ttl=3600)
def collect_social_media_data(...):
    # Cache for 1 hour
```

### 3. Error Handling
```python
try:
    data = api.search(...)
except RateLimitError:
    # Wait and retry
except AuthenticationError:
    # Log and alert
```

### 4. Cost Optimization
- Cache API responses
- Batch requests
- Use cheaper models for analysis
- Implement request throttling

### 5. Data Storage
```python
# Store results in database
db.save_research_report({
    "question": question,
    "timestamp": datetime.now(),
    "data": all_data,
    "report": report
})
```

### 6. Monitoring
- Track API usage
- Monitor execution times
- Log errors
- Alert on failures

---

## Scaling Strategies

### Horizontal Scaling
- Run multiple instances
- Load balance requests
- Distribute across regions

### Vertical Scaling
- Increase API rate limits
- Use faster models
- Optimize prompts

### Async Execution
```python
import asyncio

async def collect_all_data():
    tasks = [
        collect_social_media_data_async(...),
        collect_trends_data_async(...),
        collect_web_intelligence_async(...)
    ]
    return await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
```

## Key Takeaway

> "This is how modern marketing agencies can leverage AI: multiple specialized agents 
> working in parallel to collect data, then sequential analysis to ensure quality. 
> The result is comprehensive, client-ready research in minutes instead of days."

---

## Transition to Next Topic

**If wrapping up presentation:**
> "We've now seen all five fundamental agentic patterns: Tool Use, RAG, Multi-Agent, 
> Planning, and now this Hybrid approach. These patterns can be mixed and matched 
> for any use case. The key is understanding when to use each pattern and how to 
> combine them effectively."
